- `/tracks` - Main tracks listing page
- `/tracks/[slug]` - Individual track pages (e.g., `/tracks/mugello`)

## Features

- Grid layout showcasing all available tracks
- Track cards with key information:
  - Track name and location
  - Difficulty level badge
  - Track length and number of turns
  - Brief description
  - Track type and surface badges

### Individual Track Pages (`/tracks/[slug]`)
- Comprehensive track information including:
  - Hero section with track details
  - Quick stats (length, turns, build year, safety rating)
  - Technical specifications
  - Track record information
  - Key corners with difficulty ratings
  - Historical information
  - Upcoming track days
  - Available facilities
  - Quick action buttons

### Track Data Structure

```typescript
interface Track {
  slug: string;
  name: string;
  location: string;
  country: string;
  length: string;
  turns: number;
  description: string;
  difficulty: "Beginner" | "Intermediate" | "Advanced" | "Expert";
  type: "Road Course" | "Street Circuit" | "Oval";
  surface: "Asphalt" | "Concrete" | "Mixed";
  elevation?: string;
  recordLap?: {
    time: string;
    vehicle: string;
    driver: string;
    year: number;
  };
  facilities?: string[];
  trackdays?: {
    provider: string;
    nextDate: string;
    price: string;
  }[];
  keyCorners?: {
    name: string;
    description: string;
    difficulty: string;
  }[];
  history?: string;
  safetyRating?: number;
  yearBuilt?: number;
  lastModified?: number;
  website?: string;
  coordinates?: {
    lat: number;
    lng: number;
  };
}
```

## Static Generation

The tracks feature uses Next.js static site generation (SSG) with:
- `generateStaticParams()` to pre-render all track pages at build time
- Dynamic metadata generation for SEO optimization
- Optimized performance through static generation

## Currently Available Tracks

1. **Mugello Circuit** (Italy) - Expert level
   - Complete data including facilities, track days, and corner details
2. **Circuit de Spa-Francorchamps** (Belgium) - Expert level
3. **Nürburgring Nordschleife** (Germany) - Expert level
4. **Silverstone Circuit** (United Kingdom) - Advanced level
5. **Autodromo Nazionale Monza** (Italy) - Advanced level

## Navigation Integration

The tracks feature is integrated into the main navigation:
- Desktop: "Tracks" link in the top navigation bar
- Mobile: "Tracks" option in the mobile menu overlay

## Responsive Design

The tracks feature is fully responsive:
- Mobile: Single column layout
- Tablet: Two column grid
- Desktop: Three column grid for track cards

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements for the tracks feature:
- Integration with external APIs for real-time track day availability
- User reviews and ratings system
- Track comparison functionality
- Interactive track maps
- Weather integration
- Event calendar integration
- Booking system integration

## Development Notes

- All track data is currently stored in `/lib/tracks.ts`
- In a production environment, this would be replaced with a database or CMS
- The slug-based routing allows for SEO-friendly URLs
- Error handling includes proper 404 pages for non-existent tracks
- TypeScript ensures type safety across all track data
