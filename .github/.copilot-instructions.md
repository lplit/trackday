# TrackConnect - European Trackday Social Network

## Project Overview
TrackConnect is a social networking platform for European motorsports trackday enthusiasts, starting with the French motorcycle community. The platform focuses on social coordination features like box co-rental, event discovery, and community building rather than precise timing systems.

## Technical Stack & Architecture

### Core Technologies
- **Frontend**: Next.js with TypeScript for web-first approach
- **Hosting**: Vercel for seamless deployment and scaling
- **Database**: PostgreSQL for relational data with Prisma ORM
- **Authentication**: NextAuth.js for secure user management
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS for responsive design
- **API**: Next.js API routes for backend functionality

Supabase used for database, authentication, real-time, and storage capabilities.

### Architecture Principles
- Mobile-first responsive design (web wrapper approach, not native mobile)
- Server-side rendering for SEO and performance
- API-first design for future mobile app development
- Microservices-ready architecture for European expansion
- Real-time features using WebSockets for messaging

## Code Style & Conventions

### Naming Conventions
- Use camelCase for variables, functions, and methods
- Use PascalCase for components, interfaces, and types
- Use kebab-case for file names and API endpoints
- Use SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE for environment variables
- Prefix private methods with underscore (_)

### TypeScript Guidelines
- Use TypeScript for all new code
- Define strict interfaces for all data structures
- Use proper type annotations for function parameters and returns
- Prefer const assertions and readonly properties
- Use optional chaining (?.) and nullish coalescing (??) operators

### React/Next.js Guidelines
- Use functional components with hooks exclusively
- Implement proper error boundaries for user-facing components
- Use Next.js App Router for all routing
- Implement proper loading states and error handling
- Use React Server Components where appropriate

## Domain-Specific Features

### Motorsports Context
- Always consider trackday terminology (box, session, stint, lap time)
- Implement track-specific features (circuit layouts, sector times)
- Consider seasonal patterns in European trackday calendar
- Support multiple vehicle types (motorcycle, car, track-focused)

### Social Features
- **Box Co-rental**: Primary MVP feature for sharing trackday costs
- **Event Discovery**: Track-specific event listings and coordination
- **Community Groups**: Track-based and interest-based communities
- **Messaging**: Real-time coordination for trackday planning
- **Profile System**: Vehicle ownership, experience level, track history

### Geographic Considerations
- Multi-language support (French, English, Polish initially)
- European privacy compliance (GDPR)
- Multi-currency support (EUR primary)
- Time zone handling for international events
- Track location and routing integration

## Database Design

### Core Entities
- **Users**: Profile, experience level, vehicle ownership
- **Tracks**: European circuit database with metadata
- **Events**: Trackday events with organizer information
- **Boxes**: Shared space coordination and cost splitting
- **Messages**: Real-time communication system
- **Bookings**: Event participation and payment tracking

### Data Relationships
- Users can own multiple vehicles
- Users can participate in multiple events
- Boxes can be shared by multiple users
- Events are associated with specific tracks
- Messages are grouped by event or box context

## API Design Principles

### RESTful Endpoints
- Use descriptive resource names (/api/trackdays, /api/boxes)
- Implement proper HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)
- Use consistent response formats with proper error codes
- Implement pagination for list endpoints
- Use query parameters for filtering and sorting

### Authentication & Authorization
- Implement JWT-based authentication
- Use role-based access control (user, organizer, admin)
- Protect sensitive endpoints with proper middleware
- Implement rate limiting for API endpoints
- Log security events for monitoring

## User Experience Guidelines

### Responsive Design
- Mobile-first approach with progressive enhancement
- Touch-friendly interfaces for mobile users
- Fast loading times (<3 seconds) for all pages
- Offline-capable features for essential functionality
- Accessible design following WCAG 2.1 guidelines

### French Market Specifics
- French language as primary interface
- European date/time formats (DD/MM/YYYY)
- Metric units for all measurements
- European phone number and address formats
- French legal compliance (terms of service, privacy policy)

## Business Logic Implementation

### Freemium Model
- Free tier: basic event discovery and messaging
- Premium tier (â‚¬19.99/month): advanced coordination features
- Partnership revenue: 5% commission on trackday bookings
- Implement subscription management with Stripe
- Track usage metrics for conversion optimization

### Partnership Integration
- API integration with trackday organizers (Active-Bike, Box23)
- Event synchronization from partner systems
- Revenue sharing calculation and reporting
- Partner dashboard for event management
- White-label options for track operators

## Security & Privacy

### Data Protection
- Implement GDPR compliance mechanisms
- User consent management for data processing
- Data encryption at rest and in transit
- Regular security audits and penetration testing
- User data export and deletion capabilities

### Content Moderation
- Community guidelines enforcement
- Automated content filtering for inappropriate material
- User reporting system for community violations
- Moderation dashboard for administrators
- Appeal process for content decisions

## Performance & Scalability

### Optimization Strategies
- Image optimization for vehicle and track photos
- CDN integration for static assets
- Database query optimization with proper indexing
- Caching strategies for frequently accessed data
- Monitoring and alerting for performance issues

### European Infrastructure
- Multi-region deployment for European users
- GDPR-compliant data residency requirements
- Edge computing for improved latency
- Auto-scaling for seasonal traffic patterns
- Backup and disaster recovery procedures

## Testing & Quality Assurance

### Testing Strategy
- Unit tests for all business logic functions
- Integration tests for API endpoints
- End-to-end tests for critical user journeys
- Performance testing for high-traffic scenarios
- Security testing for authentication flows

### Code Quality
- ESLint and Prettier for consistent code formatting
- Husky pre-commit hooks for quality checks
- SonarQube integration for code quality metrics
- Dependabot for dependency updates
- Regular code reviews for all changes

## Deployment & DevOps

### CI/CD Pipeline
- GitHub Actions for automated testing and deployment
